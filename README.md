## Fitness Challenge Tracker

This website allows users to compete in a fitness challenge by entering their daily workouts. The user will be given a score based on the point per minute (ppm) value associated with their workout type (found in [`enums/workoutTypes.js`](https://github.com/elipuente/fitness-challenge/blob/main/enums/workoutTypes.js)).

Anyone can view the current standings and previously entered user workouts without needing to sign in.
